    <p>Passionate about complex UI's, sharpening pencils and all things Javascript.</p>
    <p>
      I've learned that the simple things are the most important, focusing on the basics
      and building solid foundations is the key. Complexity is unavoidable, the goal is to
      solve the problem without making it worse.

    <p>
      A big believer that attitude is the main ingredient in creating good devs and great
      teams, that attitude can be fostered and that teaching is the most effective way to
      continue learning.
