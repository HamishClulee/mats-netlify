        I've learned that the simple things are the most important, focusing on the basics
        and building solid foundations is the key. Complexity is unavoidable, the goal is
        to solve the problem without making it worse.

        A big believer that attitude is the main ingredient in creating good devs and
        great teams, that attitude can be fostered and that teaching is the most effective
        way to continue learning.
